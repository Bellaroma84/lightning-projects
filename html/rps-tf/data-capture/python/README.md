# Info

[model.ipynb](model.ipynb) uses a Logistic regression model to learn the patterns
of rock, paper, scissor and shoot hand poses. The input data are [data-adult.json](data-adult.json) and [data-kid.json](data-kid.json), which are predefined hand poses captured
from an adult and child. The output is [models.json](models.json) which is a JSON
file of the parameters of the predictive models for the hand poses.
